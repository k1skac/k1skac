### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I am BalÃ¡zs Kaczor, Junior Java Developer!
Welcome to my repository!

Right now I am actively looking for a job to start my first steps as a real programmer.
Right now I'm trying to build and expand my portfolio and I'm also working on some pet projects.
I'm trying to get out of tutorial hell, which means I'm interested in everything, right now I'm learning about Javascript, the new CSS options, react and Angular.
